# End-to-End-Patient-Health-Data-Preprocessing-Pipeline-for-Machine-Learning
This project demonstrates a complete data cleaning and preprocessing workflow for a large, messy healthcare dataset containing 10,000 patient records. The goal was to transform inconsistent, incomplete data into a clean, structured, and machine-learning-ready format.
