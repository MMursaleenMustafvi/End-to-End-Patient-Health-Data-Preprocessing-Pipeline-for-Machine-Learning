# End-to-End-Patient-Health-Data-Preprocessing-Pipeline-for-Machine-Learning
🩺 Health Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

This project demonstrates a complete data cleaning and preprocessing workflow for a large, messy healthcare dataset containing 10,000 patient records. The goal was to transform inconsistent, incomplete data into a clean, structured, and machine-learning-ready format.

🚀 Key Steps

Data Wrangling & Cleaning

Handled missing values, incorrect data types, and outliers

Standardized patient names, gender, and city names

Corrected invalid values in age, BMI, and cholesterol columns

Feature Engineering

Encoded categorical variables (gender, smoker status, city, diagnosis, etc.)

Converted text features into meaningful numerical representations

Normalized all numeric features using Min-Max scaling

Machine Learning Preparation

Produced a fully numeric dataset ready for predictive modeling

Designed the preprocessing to plug directly into ML pipelines (e.g., Scikit-learn)

🧠 Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)

Data Wrangling & Cleaning

Feature Encoding & Normalization

Exploratory Data Preparation for ML
📊 Outcome

A high-quality, realistic healthcare dataset that’s ready for model training — suitable for supervised learning tasks like disease prediction, patient risk assessment, or health trend analysis.

🧩 Future Enhancements

Add correlation analysis & feature importance visualization

Implement baseline ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

Deploy as an automated preprocessing pipeline
